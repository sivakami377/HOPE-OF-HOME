# HOPE-OF-HOME
Hope of Home is a web development initiative focused on building a 
comprehensive, intuitive website dedicated to supporting an orphanage. The 
website aims to bridge the gap between the orphanage and the community by 
raising awareness of the orphanage's needs and offering an accessible platform 
for individuals and organizations to get involved in meaningful ways. 
Provide options for community members to support the orphanage through 
volunteering, donations, or sponsorship. Showcase stories of successful 
involvement and the positive changes brought about by community 
engagement.
